GGIE Identity Use Cases
Many of the Use Cases GGIE has been exploring require knowledge about the content creator, the end client and the end user including identification, location, software/firmware capabilities, etc. This information, while necessary to accomplish GGIE’s goals, exposes many privacy issues that cannot be ignored. While solving these issues is out of scope for GGIE, identifying the issues and creating requirements based on them should be explored and documented. It is the competing needs for identity and identification of people and devices versus the expectation of privacy that are highlighted by these use cases. 
Definitions for Identity Discussions : 
Anonymity: The property of being not identifiable (within a set of subjects).  Anonymity serves as the base case for privacy: without the ability to remain anonymous, individuals may be unable to control their own privacy.  Unlinkability ensures that a user may make multiple uses of resources or services without others being able to link these uses to each other.  Unlinkability requires that entities be unable to determine whether the same user caused certain specific operations in the system. 
Pseudonym: A bit string which is unique as an ID and is suitable to be used for end-point authentication.
Unlinked Pseudonym: A pseudonym where the linking between the pseudonym and its holder is, at least initially, not known to anybody with the possible exception of the holder himself or a trusted server of the user.  Also called Initially Unlinked Pseudonym
Explicit Authentication: The act of verifying a claimed identity as the sole originator of a message (message authentication) or as the end-point of a channel (entity authentication).  Moreover, this identity is easily linked back to the real identity of the entity in question, for instance being a pre-existing static label from a predefined name space (telephone number, name, etc.)
Authorization: The act of determining if a particular right, such as access to some resource, can be granted to the presenter of a particular credential. Depending on the type of credential, authorization may or may not imply Explicit Authentication.
Linked pseudonym (not defined in RFC 3693): A pseudonym that can be linked to the true identity or to other pseudonym(s) of one or more people/objects, typically using a pseudonym certificate or token service.

Identity Use Cases
Identity Use Case 1: Family use of an ExampleCo Account
Bob has an account with ExampleCo, a provider of books, movies and games. He creates subaccounts for his wife, his adult son and his underage children ages 5 and 8.  Bob can see the spending amounts done on the account, but there are different levels of detail about purchase that he can see depending on the privacy settings of each subaccount.
He can see all of his and his wife’s spending activity, and likewise his wife can fully see his and her activity.  Both he and his wife can see the minor children’s full spending activity. The children are only able to see their own spending.  Bob can see the amount spent by his adult son, however the son has set his privacy settings to not reveal any purchase information beyond the total amount spent so far in the current billing cycle.
Since the children are young he creates a set of rules limiting what they can spend, the types of content they can access, and other aspects of their access and use of the service. He also occasionally adds “gift card” money they receive on birthdays, and money they earn from doing chores to what each child can spend.  Bob wants his children to remain anonymous to the sellers of the content they purchase.  
Finally, Bob may want to ensure their identities are fully anonymous, even if his account were to be compromised. 
Actors: 
Primary account holder
Subaccount holder
User device (tablet, PC, smart phone, TV used to access online products and services)
Network service provider 
Network interface device(s) (cable/DSL modem, smartphone, router, etc.)
Linked pseudonym service

Identity Use Case 2: Anonymizing Online Activities
Terry wants to be able to work online without having all of her activities tracked with the attendant unsolicited ads and the potential for bad actors to target her using attacks based on their growing knowledge of her web activities. 
She would like to be able to easily create and manage pseudonyms, each of which providing anonymity for her true identity with, in the extreme example, a new one being created for each online activity she performs. Each should also have a life expectancy, with the duration controlled by her, so none of them can accumulate more than a small amount of information about her online activities. One might have a longer life expectancy so that while she is looking to purchase something advertisers can target ads but the accumulation of data about her activities ends when she either “deletes” the pseudonym or it reaches its preset “end of life”. Others may be single use or only last for a preset period based on the activity it is associated with or other rules. 
Although what she is looking for is an application, the tools needed to create such an application are the target of this use case. Control of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) provided directly (passwords, user IDs, etc., or indirectly such as IP and MAC addresses and “finger prints” of her devices’ hardware, software, settings, etc., during her online activities is key since it can be used to tie her pseudonyms to each other creating linkages that can be tracked over time resulting in accumulation of data about her. For advertisers to collect data from a given activity or set of activities and provide ads or and other services requires a path to her device without tying that path to her identity or to her other pseudonyms.

Identity Use Case 3: Anonymizing the Creation of Content
John is an amateur photographer and videographer. He posts many of his creations, often for profit using contributions by viewers, advertising or more directly by offering it for sale. Some of his work is controversial and has in the past generated vitriolic responses and even threats to him and his family. 
He would like to be able to control if and when his true identity is attached to his work as well as have the ability to use a linked pseudonym or an anonymous pseudonym. His true identity would be used to build his portfolio. A linked pseudonym might be used to allow audiences to follow his work and to allow him to profit from those works without revealing his identify to the public. Multiple linked pseudonyms would allow him to target different audiences with different works. One of more anonymous pseudonyms would allow his to post his more controversial work without fear of having it linked to him or his family. 
Recognizing that it is not just his name that can be used to identify him, he wants to be able to control access to other PII that could be used to identify him under the various scenarios. Location, date and time, information about his camera/smart phone/tablet, IP addresses, etc., can also be used to tie his pseudonyms to his true identity. However, he would like to maintain the ability for this information to be recovered for billing or other purposes, at least in the case of linked pseudonyms. 
Identity Use Case 4: Linking Content to a Unique Identity (Pseudonym)
Bob has created a number of unique videos and published them on various sites.  He decided to use a unique identity for himself, a pseudonym, for each video that he published and continued to use that unique identity when he published the video on other platforms.  Any derivative or related work should be linked to the original video and to his unique ID. He now wants to unify the social media experience – comments, likes/dislikes, related and even derivative works for each video so that viewers can view the unified social media experience for the video on a website that Bob has setup to highlight the video. In effect, each video he created, along with anything related to that video is tied to a unique identity created specifically for that body of work. 

Identity Use Case 5: Selling Content and Related Assets Linked to a Unique Identity (Pseudonym)
Building on Identity Use Case 4, whereby a unique ID is linked to each video and all derivative work, social media sites experiences, etc., associated with that video. A buyer has offered to buy the rights to several of his videos.  Bob now needs to bundle the videos he is selling and transfer them to the new owner. He must identify the specific videos and related assets he is selling. 
Question: Does the sale include just the video or does it include any or all related and/or derivative works, social media links, etc.? 
 
Identity Use Case 6: Severing Links Between Content/Related Assets and a Unique Identity
Building on Use Case 5, rather than sell one of the videos and related assets Bob owns, he would like to either abandon it (completely sever any ties to himself and any of his identities) or actively donate it to the public domain (create a new link to the public domain) while either leaving intact ties to either his real identity or another pseudonym for marketing purposes or completely sever all links. 



Identity Use Case 7: Severing Links to a Compromised Identity
Bob has an account with ExampleCo. He set up an identity (pseudonym) with ExampleCo to provide some privacy with respect to his purchases, and as an added layer of security for the associated financial transactions. ExampleCo does not have a direct link to his financial institutions. Instead Bob uses his unique ID to request payment to ExampleCo from an intermediary institution, SafePay. He has been informed that ExampleCo has been hacked and his identity information stolen. Bob wishes to abandon that ID severing all ties to it, and create a new unique ID in its place. 
Bob would also like to assign the old ID to a law enforcement agency or organization so it can be used to help track down the thief or whomever purchased it from the thief in the event they attempt to use it.
